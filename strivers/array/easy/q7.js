// Move all Zeros to the end of the array


// In this article we will learn how to solve the most asked coding interview problem: "Move all Zeros to the end of the array"

// Problem Statement: You are given an array of integers, your task is to move all the zeros in the array to the end of the array and move non-negative integers to the front by maintaining their order.


// Brute Force Approach: 
// The extremely naive solution, we can think of, involves the use of an extra array. The algorithm is as follows.

// Algorithm:
// Suppose, there are N-X zeros and X non-zero elements in the array. We will first copy those X non-zero elements from the original array to a temporary array. 
// Then, we will copy the elements from the temporary array one by one and fill the first X places of the original array. 
// The last N-X places of the original array will be then filled with zero. Now, our task is completed.

function moveZeros(n, a) {
    // Temporary array
    let temp = [];

    // Copy non-zero elements from original array to temp array
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (a[i] !== 0) {
            temp.push(a[i]);
        }
    }

    // Number of non-zero elements
    let nz = temp.length;

    // Copy elements from temp and fill the first nz fields of the original array
    for (let i = 0; i < nz; i++) {
        a[i] = temp[i];
    }
    // Fill the rest of the cells with 0
    for (let i = nz; i < n; i++) {
        a[i] = 0;
    }

    return a;
}

let arr = [1, 0, 2, 3, 2, 0, 0, 4, 5, 1];
let n = 10;
let ans = moveZeros(n, arr);
console.log(ans.join(' '));


// Output: 1 2 3 2 4 5 1 0 0 0


// Optimal Approach(Using 2 pointers): 
// We can optimize the approach using 2 pointers i.e. i and j. The pointer j will point to the first 0 in the array and i will point to the next index.

// Assume, the given array is {1, 0, 2, 3, 2, 0, 0, 4, 5, 1}. Now, initially, we will place the 2-pointers like the following:

// Algorithm:
// First, using a loop, we will place the pointer j. If we donâ€™t find any 0, we will not perform the following steps.
// After that, we will point i to index j+1 and start moving the pointer using a loop.
// While moving the pointer i, we will do the following:
// If a[i] != 0 i.e. a[i] is a non-zero element: We will swap a[i] and a[j]. Now, the current j is pointing to the non-zero element a[i]. So, we will shift the pointer j by 1 so that it can again point to the first zero.
// Finally, our array will be set in the right manner.


function moveZeros(n, a) {
    let j = -1;
    
    // Place the pointer j
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (a[i] === 0) {
            j = i;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    // No non-zero elements
    if (j === -1) return a;
    
    // Move the pointers i and j and swap accordingly
    for (let i = j + 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (a[i] !== 0) {
            [a[i], a[j]] = [a[j], a[i]];
            j++;
        }
    }
    
    return a;
}

let arr2 = [1, 0, 2, 3, 2, 0, 0, 4, 5, 1];
let n2 = 10;
let ans2 = moveZeros(n2, arr2);
console.log(ans2.join(' '));
